Running Instruction:
	Open Virtual Machine
	Run the Python code by putting: "python3 freq.py textfile"

How the code runs:
	Argument is passed in code via command line
	Splits the code into individual words and stores it into variable WordList
	Once passed in, the word list is sorted
	Then the for loop will go through all of the elemnts totalling up how many times they appear and store it into a list
	The line if CurrentWord!=WordList[i] is important as a word will appear multiple times so this will prevent the same word being stored into the frequency table without the need of making a dictionary
	Table is then sorted and passed into another function to store it into an output file
	
Known Issues:
	Making a dictioanry will make this code more efficient
